libPCY (simple c/c++ encryption library).

PCY is based off of the following:

byte #1, separated into two nibbles, first is the one time pad, the second the bit pattern
byte #2, bits0-6 are the frequency of the swap, bit 7 is the byte swap flag
byte #3, frequency of the one time pad
byte #4, frequency of the bit pattern
byte #5, bits 0-2: the encryption order, bits3-7: the frequency of padding bytes (random)

Steps:
1: apply one time pad to all bytes (addition)
2: apply the bit pattern
3: apply padding bytes
4: perform byte swap
order (000): 1234
order (001): 4321
order (010): 1432
order (011): 2143
order (100): 3142
order (101): 2431
order (110): 4231
order (111): 4123

Compiling:
for OSX, this is really simple, it compiles the dynamic libs as they would be needed.
for linux, you just need to change the extension from .dylib to .so (afaik)
for windows, good luck..It will compile, but you're better off just adding the src to your project

Usage:
just include <pcy.h> and -lpcy
